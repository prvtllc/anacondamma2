Recently, the news website [hackers.tech reported that UW patient data was exposed online](http://www.hackers.tech/security/incident-of-the-week-uw-medicine-patient-data-exposed-online/). This is not a run of the mill data leak. In this case, the information related to 974,000 patients was posted to Google nonetheless. The information that leaked included The files contained: Name, Medical record number, With whom UW Medicine shared your information. A description of what information about you was shared (For example, &#8220;demographics&#8221;, &#8220;office visits&#8221; or &#8220;labs&#8221;). The reason for the disclosure, such as mandatory reporting or screening to see if you qualified for a research study. That&#8217;s a lot of freaking info!

How was it discovered? Check it out! Megan Flory says that she accessed some of the UW Medicine files through a Google search last month after a friend discovered the exposed personal information when looking up a person&#8217;s name she&#8217;d met. &#8220;Upset about something she&#8217;d stumbled across online,&#8221; said Flory. &#8220;It clearly said it was UW Medicine.&#8221; Flory said there were as many as 120 names in the UW Medicine files she accessed through a Google search that also included the names of those patient&#8217;s lab tests but not the results. &#8220;HIV was one of them! &#8220;That was what they all were, pretty much,&#8221; said Flory. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t know what it means, it&#8217;s maybe easier to kind of assume it&#8217;s the worst.&#8221; Flory said she then spoke with a woman at UW Medicine to report what she&#8217;d found online. &#8220;Having things out on Google like that is scary,&#8221; said Flory. &#8220;You know it could be upsetting or devastating for somebody.&#8221;<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption">
